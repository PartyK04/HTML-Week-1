      Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.<br /><br />
      It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
      <br /><br />
      making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
      Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,<br /><br />
      looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
      Ipsum passage,<br /><br />
      and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,<br /><br />
      discovered the undoubtable source.<br /><br />
      Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
      et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
      BC.<br /><br />
      This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
      Renaissance.<br /><br />
      The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from
      a line in section 1.10.32.
